This project is a personal playground.
I am implementing an electronic version of a famous board game.
Because it is a playground, it is not meant to be a work like project. Commits are dirty, test more less there, technology choices not necessary pragmatic, etc. 

The end-goal is to have a game that can be played in real-time, as well as asynchronously (play by mail).


## Dev Env
`npm start` - Start the UI - create React app
`npm server:dev` - Start the server (typescript compilation + auto restart)
`npm test` - Jest test watcher
`npm run tsc` - TypeScript
